Louisa Reese's Front-End Project Proposal
Uses and Users
--
	This web app is targeted towards users looking for events to attend in their area, being able to sort by date, price, and type of event.


Technologies Involved
--
This site will be presented using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for styling, and will become interactive with jquery and javascript.  I will be using the Eventbrite API to return information about upcoming events based on the user's location and other sorting options.
